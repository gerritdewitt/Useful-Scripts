About
----------
This folder contains materials for creating an Apple Installer package with the Alertus Desktop software.

The _make-installer-pkg.sh_ script is an “admin script” designed to be run from an admin Mac.  It will ask you for version information and installation source materials provided by the vendor.  It is interactive and easily auditable.

Why Repackage
----------
We repackage the Alertus Desktop software because:
   * The vendor's installer sources installation materials, namely configuration files and branding, from outside of the Installer pkg itself.  This has two immediate problems:
      * The installer pkg must be “wrapped” in a disk image or zip archive with the other materials.  The other materials must be in the same parent path as the pkg.
      * A custom Installer Plugin is used to accomplish the sourcing of out-of-pkg materials.  This only works in an Aqua session; mass deployment isn't possible with the vendor's method.
   * The vendor's installer sets filesystem permissions insecurely. See http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/302544.

Creating Package
----------
To build the installer package, simply run the _make-installer-pkg.sh_ script.  The script is interactive; it will produce an Apple Installer package.

The script asks for the following information:
   * The path to the disk image containing the unmodified Alertus Desktop installer pkg.
   * The path to the _AlertusDesktopAlert.exe.config_ file.
   * The path to the _logo1.gif_ file.
   * A version number (typically year.month as the package is specific to the customer).
   * A package identifier (e.g. edu.gsu.alertus.desktop)

The resulting package is named _Alertus_Desktop-&lt;version&gt;.pkg_.  It is in the same directory as the _make-installer-pkg.sh_ script.

Deploying with Munki
----------
To deploy, add the resulting installer package to the Munki repository and configure it as an optional or managed install.

For example:
<pre>
# Copy to repo:
sudo cp Alertus_Desktop-2016.06.pkg /mounts/munki-repo/pkgs/
# Generate pkginfo:
sudo -s
makepkginfo --unattended_install --name Alertus_Desktop --displayname="Alertus Desktop" \
--pkgvers=2016.06 --catalog=software --developer="Alertus" --category="Alertus" \
/mounts/munki-repo/pkgs/Alertus_Desktop-2016.06.pkg > /mounts/munki-repo/pkgsinfo/Alertus_Desktop-2016.06
exit
# Update catalogs:
sudo makecatalogs
# Add to manifest:
sudo manifestutil add-pkg Alertus_Desktop --section managed_installs --manifest some_manifest</pre>
