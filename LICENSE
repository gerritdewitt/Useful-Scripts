The GPL license, referenced below, applies to the code for the Useful Scripts (a/k/a Munki Scripts)
written by Gerrit DeWitt for Georgia State University.

This project makes use of existing open-source and publicly-documented know-how
(collectively, "the existing items").  Refer to the various ReadMe.md files for references.
Where practical, we have documented sources for know-how except for when generally
known to those skilled in the art or otherwise in the public domain.

We believe the existing items are either:
   - licensed to the public in a manner consistent with the creation of a derivative
work which can be licensed under the terms of the GPL, or
   - that they are simply facts and information, which are not copyrightable.

This license in no way restricts your rights to the existing items.
